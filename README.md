# Multisensor platform

<img src="Graphics/Soil cut.png">


## Introduction

The recognition of global change impacts on catchments and the waters they drain emphasizes the need to better understand hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics across terrestrial-aquatic interfaces. To achieve this great endeavor, a key priority is to substantially increase the number of multiannual time series, covering larger environmental gradients and filling existing geographical gaps (e.g., low-income regions in/and the Global South). However, commercial environmental sensors solutions are not affordable to everyone.

## Goals

To design, build and optimize a DIY multi-sensor platform for monitoring hydrological
and biogeochemical dynamics in fluvial ecosystems and their adjacent soils. This
project revolves around these pillars:
 * Using self-made, low-cost solutions to make it more afordable to everyone.
 * Adopting the open source hardware phylosphy so that the broad community
can freely use or modify the components to adapt them to their own needs.
 * Using open source hosting services for software development to ensures the
re-usability of the code.
 * Using open source web applications for interactive visualization.

## live data visualisation
