## Introduction

The recognition of global change impacts on catchments and the waters they drain emphasizes the need to better understand hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics across terrestrial-aquatic interfaces. To achieve this great endeavor, a key priority is to substantially increase the number of multiannual time series, covering larger environmental gradients and filling existing geographical gaps (e.g., low-income regions in/and the Global South). However, commercial environmental sensors solutions are not affordable to everyone.
